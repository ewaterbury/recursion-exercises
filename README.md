Two practice exercise related to recursion: Merge Sort and Fibonacci.

# Fibonacci
Write a two functions (one iterative and one recursive) that take a number(8) and return an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

# Merge Sort
Build a function that takes in an array([3, 2, 1, 12, 8, 5, 0, 1]) and returns a sorted array using a recursive merge sort methodology([0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 8, 13]).
